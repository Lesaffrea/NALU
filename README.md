# NALU

## Under progress

To start training, run -
```
python NAC.py
```

To test the trained model run - 
```
python NAC_test.py
```
The results at different extrapolation ranges can be obtained by changing the sequence_length value.

Currently the code achieves a mean absolute error of 17.17 and 242.25 at extrapolation lengths of 10 and 100 respectively.
